        "Bus firm 'refused to transport asylum seekers from Peckham hotel to the Bibby Stockholm barge amid huge protests because they feared they would get negative publicity'\n",
        "Protesters blocked the route from a Best Western Hotel in Peckham\n",
        "A bus firm which refused to transport asylum seekers from a hotel to the Bibby Stockholm barge thought they would get 'negative publicity', a court heard.\n",
        "Protesters blocked the route from a Best Western Hotel in Peckham, South East London to the infamous accommodation barge for migrants at 8.30am on May 2.\n",
        "Stratford magistrates' court heard yesterday that the bus company contracted by the Border Force declared it wouldn't move them because they were worried about optics and it wasn't 'enforced'.\n",
        "The vehicle was surrounded by protesters and one of the tyres was deflated. Police attended the scene but around 60 activists later began to surround three police carriers as they detained people.\n",
        "The court was told that the group was 'three layers deep and fortified with push bikes and hire bikes' in the road.\n",
        "Jony Cink, 23, and Indea Barbe-Wilson, 31, went on trial charged with obstruction of the highway.\n",
        "Barbe-Wilson is alleged to have sat in front of a police vehicle because she 'wanted to stop them from experiencing any more trauma', it was heard.\n",
        "During her evidence, Barbe-Wilson said she 'wanted to go and stop them from being moved to Bibby Stockholm' and arrived about five minutes before she was arrested.\n",
        "The defendant said she believed the coach was still in place and did not know it had already been moved and there had been arrests.\n",
        "She said she sat, joined other protesters and started joining chants of 'this is what community looks like'.\n",
        "Barbe-Wilson, who is a student, said from what she had read in the news about whistleblowers who had previously worked on Bibby Stockholm, 'it is not a good place'.\n",
        "The barge, moored off the coast of Portland in Dorset, is the only accommodation barge for migrants commissioned so far by ministers and has faced a series of setbacks since its arrival.\n",
        "The discovery of dangerous bacteria led to its evacuation last summer just days after the arrival of the first asylum seekers, and it remained vacant for two months.\n",
        "The Bibby Stockholm: A People's Inquiry spoke to a number of former residents for first-hand accounts of what life was like on the vessel.\n",
        "The report, produced by Care4Calais, Stand Up To Racism and the Portland Global Friendship Group, called for the immediate closure of the barge and no renewal of its contract, as well as investment in asylum claim decision-makers.\n",
        "Barbe-Wilson told the court: 'My understanding is that they wouldn't be treated well, they would experience further trauma, they're people who had been through enough already and had come here for safety.'\n",
        "'I wanted to stop them from experiencing any more trauma.'\n",
        "Barbe-Wilson said: 'Honestly, if I had known that the coach had not been there and if I had known there had already been arrests, I wouldn't have sat down, I wouldn't have the guts or thought there was any point in it, it wasn't an anti-police action.'\n",
        "When police first arrived at the scene, a number of people were surrounding the coach which was in a bus lane, but traffic was able to move freely down the road initially, Superintendent Matt Cox said.\n",
        "He said very early on he was informed by the company contracted by Border Force that they would no longer be moving the asylum seekers 'as they did not want any negative publicity or whatever it was' and it 'was not an enforced move'.\n",
        "Police became aware that one of the coach's tyres had been deflated and said a decision was made for officers to try and get in between the protesters and the coach.\n",
        "The coach was later moved and about 60 protesters began to surround three police carriers which suspects were being placed inside, prosecutor Timothy Fulford told the court.\n",
        "About four hours after the protest started when arrests were being made, 'there was a lot of pushing and shoving going on with police officers trying to remove protesters, but also protesters trying to stop police officers undertaking their lawful duty', Mr Cox said.\n",
        "The whole road became blocked 'very quickly' and Mr Cox tried to communicate with the protesters while a drummer followed him 'making an awful lot of noise', the court heard.\n",
        "Mr Cox said: 'It was probably one of the most chaotic scenes and one of the hardest ones for police officers to deal with in a long time.'\n",
        "The welfare of the suspects on the police carriers was a concern for him as they did not know who may or may not have needs to care for, he added.\n",
        "He estimated the protesters were surrounding the police carriers for about two hours until 3.25pm.\n",
        "Chief Inspector Vicky Causbrook described 'several hundred' people watching on at about 3pm who 'weren't able to catch buses or go about their daily lives'.\n",
        "And a school wanted to let its students leave at the end of the day, but 'was afraid to because of the noise and the protest and the risk to the students', she added.\n",
        "Her body-worn camera footage was played to the court which showed a police cordon near the scene as drums and chanting could be heard, and people booing at one stage.\n",
        "The moment Cink was arrested was played to the court on PC Ian Rawsthorne's body-worn camera footage.\n",
        "He was sat linking arms with others when the officer pulled him up, then for part of the journey to the police carrier Cink was carried horizontally.\n",
        "PC Rawsthorne said that during the defendant's arrest 'there was not aggressive resistance but he wasn't assisting either'.\n",
        "Footage of Barbe-Wilson's arrest was also played, which showed the defendant sat with her arms linked with others and being told to release her arms before she was handcuffed and brought to the police carrier.\n",
        "The trial continues.\n",

Published on October 1st, 2025 at 18:45 GMT+1. Updated last night with the latest developments from Downing Street and Brussels.\\n\\nThe UK government has been accused of breaking its own rules in an attempt to salvage Brexit negotiations by pushing through controversial changes without proper parliamentary approval, according to opposition politicians and legal experts quoted today. The move comes after a series of failed talks with the European Union that have left both sides at loggerheads over fishing rights, trade agreements, and governance structures for Northern Ireland post-Brexit.\\n\\n\"The government is acting in bad faith,\" said Labour MP Tom Hunt during Prime Minister\\'s Questions today as he read out a letter from the Cabinet Office to Parliament that proposed changes without seeking consent first. \"This goes against everything we stand for.\" The Conservative Party, which has been divided over Brexit strategy since 2016 when it voted narrowly in favour of leaving the EU under Theresa May\\'s leadership, is now facing internal rifts as well with some members calling for a second referendum to break the deadlock.\\n\\nThe letter from Cabinet Office Minister James Smith stated that \"urgent action\" was needed and asked Parliament not only to approve but also amend certain clauses in order to move forward on Brexit, despite opposition parties\\' objections. The Labour Party has already threatened legal challenges against the government if it proceeds with this unilateral approach while other Conservative backbenchers have expressed support for a second referendum as an alternative solution.\\n\\n\"We cannot let our democracy be hijacked by extremists on both sides,\" said Tory MP Elizabeth Clarke, who has been vocal about her concerns over the government\\'s handling of Brexit negotiations and its impact on Northern Ireland peace process established under Good Friday Agreement in 1998. \"We need to find a way forward that respects everyone\\'s views.\"\\n\\nThe EU Commissioner for European Political Strategy, Hans Müller, warned today against any further unilateral actions by the UK government and urged both sides to return to negotiations table with an open mind in order to reach mutually beneficial outcomes. \"We are ready to listen,\" he said during a press conference at Brussels headquarters where EU officials discussed next steps for Brexit talks after months of stalemate over key issues such as fishing rights, trade deals and governance arrangements post-Brexit that have left both sides frustrated.\\n\\n\"We cannot afford to let this deadlock continue,\" said Müller while pointing out the need for compromise from all parties involved in order to move forward with Brexit process which has been on hold since 2016 when UK voted narrowly by a margin of just over 3 million votes against leaving EU. \"We must find common ground and work together towards an amicable solution.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Scottish National Party (SNP) leader in Scotland\\'s Parliament, Nicola Sturgeon has called for another referendum on independence from UK as a way out of Brexit deadlock which she believes would give people across Britain more say over their future outside EU. \"We cannot let ourselves be dictated by Westminster,\" said SNP MP Angus MacDonald during an interview with BBC Scotland where he argued that Scottish voters should have the right to decide whether they want independence or remain part of UK after Brexit vote in 2016 which resulted narrowly against leaving EU.\\n\\n\"We need a new referendum on our future as Scots,\" said MacDonald, who has been vocal about his concerns over how Brexit negotiations have impacted Scotland\\'s economy and its relationship with the rest of UK since then when he was elected leader in 2014 after winning majority vote against Ruth Davidson from Conservative Party. \"We deserve a chance to shape our own destiny.\"\\n\\nThe SNP has been pushing for another independence referendum ever since Brexit negotiations began, arguing that Scotland should have the right to decide whether it wants remain part of UK or become independent country after 2016 vote against leaving EU. However, Westminster government led by Boris Johnson and his Conservative Party has repeatedly rejected calls for another referendum citing legal barriers as well as political implications that could further divide society already divided over Brexit issue since then when UK voted narrowly to leave in 2016 with majority of Scotland voting against leaving EU.\\n\\n\"We cannot go back on our word,\" said Johnson during a press conference last week where he reiterated his commitment towards delivering \"a good and speedy deal for the whole country.\" He also dismissed calls from SNP leader Sturgeon to hold another referendum, saying that it would only create more division among people.\\n\\n\"We need unity now,\" said Johnson while urging all parties involved in Brexit negotiations including EU officials at Brussels headquarters and UK government representatives back home not just for themselves but also future generations who will inherit the consequences of their decisions today.\"Let\\'s work together towards a brighter tomorrow, regardless of our differences,\" he added.\\n\\n### Extracted News Actors:',\n",
